# ParallelTaskDemo
Sample project showing the parallel task usage in C#

I have taken help from below articles.
Kick start - http://blog.stephencleary.com/2010/06/reporting-progress-from-tasks.html
How to pause\resume async task - http://blogs.msdn.com/b/pfxteam/archive/2013/01/13/cooperatively-pausing-async-methods.aspx

The above two articles are really helpful for anyone new to parallel programming in C#.

The sample project in this repository is only for learning purpose and only demonstrates the parallel task and programming in C#.
